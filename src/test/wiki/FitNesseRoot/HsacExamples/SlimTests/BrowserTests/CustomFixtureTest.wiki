!1 Website testing using custom subclass of !-BrowserTest-!

On this page we test whether we can find a nice house which is for sale in Utrecht, The Netherlands and check how many photos are available. 
 * First we do this with ''plain !-BrowserTest-!'', 
 * then with a ''custom subclass, !-nl.hsac.fitnesse.sample.FundaTest-!'', and 
 * finally with a [[Slim scenario][.FitNesse.UserGuide.WritingAcceptanceTests.SliM.ScenarioTable]].
The latter two approaches both make the test (i.e. the script table containing the test) more descriptive, and less fragile to HTML changes.

Doing this in Java 'hides' the exact way the number of photos is determined from the test (and its result). While a scenario would have made this part of the 'test domain'.
Hiding details can either be a good (e.g. more focus on what is relevant to test, smaller test report), or bad (e.g. 'what was done exactly in this method?') thing.
Which approach is more suitable depends on your tests' context (and the complexity of what is to be done)...

There are some things a Java method can do that a scenario cannot: for instance using conditional logic (''if'' statements), or looping (''for'' or ''while'' statements).

Using a custom subclass, makes the script look like...

!2 Using !-FundaTest-!


We need to indicate in which package our custom class can be found.
|import                 |
|nl.hsac.fitnesse.sample|

|script|funda test                                              |
|open  |http://www.funda.nl                                     |
|select|€ 1.000.000           |for   |Van                       |

And using a scenario

!2 Using a Scenario

The scenario 'hides' the xpath from the test script, but its definition can be found (and updated) in the wiki. And the test report/result will show what was done (unlike for the custom fixture).
No Java knowledge or development environment is needed to create and maintain a scenario, which may also be an advantage.

|scenario|check number of photos|expected                                                    |
|check   |value of              |xpath=//span[@class='object-media-teaser-count']|@{expected}|

|script                |browser test                                    |
|open                  |http://www.funda.nl                             |
